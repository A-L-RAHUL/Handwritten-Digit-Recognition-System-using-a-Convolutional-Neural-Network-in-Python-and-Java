# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-System-using-a-Convolutional-Neural-Network-in-Python-and-Java
This project addresses the challenge of automated recognition of
handwritten digit sequences through a comprehensive two-step approach
involving initial digit segmentation and subsequent digit classification using a
recognition module. The practical implications span various domains such as mail
sorting, bank check processing, and form data entry. The central focus is on
developing a robust algorithm capable of efficiently identifying handwritten digits
from diverse sources like scanners and digital devices. Handwritten character
recognition is one of the practically important issues in pattern recognition
applications. The main purpose of this project is to build an automatic handwritten
digit recognition method for the recognition of handwritten digit strings. The
applications of digit recognition include postal mail sorting, bank check
processing, form data entry, etc. The heart of the problem lies within the ability to
develop an efficient algorithm that can recognize handwritten digits and which is
submitted by users by way of a scanner, tablet, and other digital devices.
